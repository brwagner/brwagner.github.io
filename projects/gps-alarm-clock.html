I found myself asleep on the bus headed home many times after long days and I found myself missing my stop several times because of it. My dad who also takes the bus into the city every day has the same problem occasionally. I've finally gotten around to solving this problem by creating a "GPS guided alarm clock" app for android. The app itself is pretty simple. Just type in your destination and how far away you want to be before being woken up.

I ended up dealing with this problem by setting the GPS to be less accurate the further away you are from your destination and more and more accurate as you get closer. This project was mostly an exercise in exploring the Android SDK and the Google Maps API so I am not going to release the source code as most of it was exploratory coding.</p></div></div></main><footer class="page-footer" style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><div class="right-align container">Â© 2017 Benjamin Rajs Wagner</div></footer></body></html>
