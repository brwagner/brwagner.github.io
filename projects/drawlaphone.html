The concept is simple. The players start with a phrase, player one whispers it to player two, player two whispers to player three and so on and so on until the message gets completely distorted. You also might have played 'Picture Telephone' which is similar but instead of whispering, the mechanism for distorting the message is converting it between text and crudely drawn pictures. Here's an example of how a typical game might progress.

To start playing with your friends you first create an account and then log on. Then you can host or join a game. Once a game has enough players the game begins and control alternates between people guessing with words and people guessing with pictures until the game is over. Then, all of the players who played that game can look at the monstrosities they've created.

Also trying to keep the number of API requests down.</p></div></div></main><footer class="page-footer" style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><div class="right-align container">Â© 2017 Benjamin Rajs Wagner</div></footer></body></html>
