The project took place over the course of a month. I was the UI programmer and designer for the project.

For STAR Submarine, the player moves the submarine by queuing up a series of commands for the sub to do. The player has to be able to modify and add commands in an intuitive way, which was a challenge to design.

Everything worked, but most of the code I wrote could have been cleaner and certain features could have been implemented better. I did not have much previous experience working with UI at the time and I wasn't aware of certain paradigms and patterns in UI programming such as using adapters, properties, and observers to separate the model from the view. Now that I have more experience developing user interfaces for Android apps, I think I would be much better at developing a GUI this time around.
